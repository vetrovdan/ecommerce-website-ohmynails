# Designing an e-commerce store for a small nail business

This is my first attempt at coding and designing an e-commerce store.
The purpose of this was to utilize Shopify's starter package which only includes a 'buy button' (no website builder) as it is much more cost effective.

Furthermore, it allows me to begin on a personal portfolio.
